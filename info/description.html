<p>
    You are given a string and two markers (the initial and final). You have to find a substring enclosed between these two markers. But there are a few important conditions:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The initial and final markers are always different.</li>
	<li>If there is no initial marker then the beginning should be considered as the beginning of a string.</li>
	<li>If there is no final marker then the ending should be considered as the ending of a string.</li>
    <li>If the initial and final markers are missing then simply return the whole string.</li>
	<li>If the final marker is standing in front of the initial one then return an empty string.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Three arguments. All of them are strings. The second and third arguments are the initial and final markers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> A string.
